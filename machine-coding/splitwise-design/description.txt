Input
You can create a few users in your main method. No need to take it as input.
There will be 3 types of input:
Expense in the format: EXPENSE <user-id-of-person-who-paid> <no-of-users> <space-separated-list-of-users> <EQUAL/EXACT/PERCENT> <space-separated-values-in-case-of-non-equal>
Show balances for all: SHOW
Show balances for a single user: SHOW <user-id>
Output
When asked to show balance for a single user. Show all the balances that user is part of:
Format: <user-id-of-x> owes <user-id-of-y>: <amount>
If there are no balances for the input, print No balances
In cases where the user for which balance was asked for, owes money, they’ll be x. They’ll be y otherwise.

Expectations
Make sure that you have a working and demonstrable code
Make sure that the code is functionally correct
Code should be modular and readable
Separation of concern should be addressed
Please do not write everything in a single file
Code should easily accommodate new requirements and minimal changes
There should be a main method from where the code could be easily testable
[Optional] Write unit tests, if possible
No need to create a GUI
Optional Requirements
Please do these only if you’ve time left. You can write your code such that these could be accommodated without changing your code much.

A way to add an expense name while adding the expense. Can also add notes, images, etc.
Option to split by share. Ex: ‘User4 pays and everyone splits equally. You pay for 2 people.’ could be added as: u4 1200 4 u1 u2 u3 u4 SHARE 2 1 1 1
A way to show the passbook for a user. The entries should show all the transactions a user was part of. You can print in any format you like.
There can be an option to simplify expenses. When simplify expenses is turned on (is true), the balances should get simplified. Ex: ‘User1 owes 250 to User2 and User2 owes 200 to User3’ should simplify to ‘User1 owes 50 to User2 and 200 to User3’.
