Input: 		3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 2, 5, 3

Output: 	4, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0


Considering the fact: (2,5) and (1,6)

When 2 and 1 compared  it means 1 is smaller to 2 and because it is on right; we found that count of smaller number 2 will be increased by 1 and we know that 2,5 are sorted and they lie on left, and so count (5) should be increased to.
We need a stable sort in this case merge sort; stable means order will remain intact.
In such a case consider again a new number comes which is less than 2--. So again we need to update the count values for each number in left array.
O (n) * O (n) == O (n^2)
Can we optimize this counts
One other thing we can do is to increment the right-count when we add something from the left. And when we add something from right; add this right-count to count(of that element)
This will cause merge method to avoid O(n2)  o(n)

And so overall algorithm will be same as merge sort  o(nlogn)

How we update count(ele)  one thing we can use HashMap but what if elements has duplicates.
Then mapping may result wrong.
What other thing we can do we will sort the indexes or array instead of original array. In this ways index will be unique.
Element  nums[index] where nums is the original array.
Count(nums[index]);
